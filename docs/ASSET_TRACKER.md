| 8 | BIRD | Little bird in cage | no | no | 1 | The bird's singing is quite melodious. • The bird does not seem inclined to sing while in the cage. • It almost seems as though the bird is trying to tell you something. • To your surprise, you can understand the bird's chirping; it is singing about the joys of its forest home. • The bird does not seem inclined to sing while in the cage. • The bird is singing to you in gratitude for your having returned it to its home. In return, it informs you of a magic word which it thinks you may find useful somewhere near the Hall of Mists. The magic word changes frequently, but for now the bird believes it is "%s". You thank the bird for this information, and it flies off into the forest. |
