 * state tangles together information about whether the object is a
 * treasure, whether the player has seen it yet, and its activation
 * state.
 *
 * Things we think we know:
 *
 * STATE_NOTFOUND is only set on treasures. Non-treasures start the
 * game in STATE_FOUND.
 *
 * PROP_STASHIFY is supposed to map a state property value to a
 * negative range, where the object cannot be picked up but the value
 * can be recovered later.  Various objects get this property when
 * the cave starts to close. Only seems to be significant for the bird
 * and readable objects, notably the clam/oyster - but the code around
 * those tests is difficult to read.
 *
 * All tests of the prop member are done with either these macros or ==.
