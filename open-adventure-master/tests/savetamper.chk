You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and
down a gully.

A dark fog creeps in to surround you.  From somewhere in the fog you
hear a stern voice.  "This Adventure has been tampered with!  You have
been dabbling in magic, knowing not the havoc you might cause thereby.
Leave at once, before you do irrevocable harm!"  The fog thickens,
until at last you can see nothing at all.  Your vision then clears,
and you find yourself back in The Real World.
