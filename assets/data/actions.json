To move, try words\nlike forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south,\nup, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod\nhidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of\nthe action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the\nobject and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer\nthe object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in\nparticular, \"inventory\" implies \"take inventory\", which causes me to\ngive you a list of what you're carrying.  Some objects have unexpected\neffects; the effects are not always desirable!  Usually people having\ntrouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people\ntrying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something\nbeyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely\ndifferent tack.  One point often confusing to beginners is that, when\nthere are several ways to go in a certain direction (e.g., if there\nare several holes in a wall), choosing that direction in effect\nchooses one of the ways at random; often, though, by specifying the\nplace you want to reach you can guarantee choosing the right path.\nAlso, to speed the game you can sometimes move long distances with a\nsingle word.  For example, \"building\" usually gets you to the building\nfrom anywhere above ground except when lost in the forest.  Also, note\nthat cave passages and forest paths turn a lot, so leaving one place\nheading north doesn't guarantee entering the next from the south.\nHowever (another important point), except when you've used a \"long\ndistance\" word such as \"building\", there is always a way to go back\nwhere you just came from unless I warn you to the contrary, even\nthough the direction that takes you back might not be the reverse of\nwhat got you here.

To get full\ncredit for a treasure, you must have left it safely in the building,\nthough you get partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points\nfor getting killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you more.\nThere are also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've\nmanaged to explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for\ngetting in (to distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack),\nand there are other ways to determine whether you've been through some\nof the more harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the\ntreasures, just keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting\nhappens, you haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting\n*DOES* happen (incidentally, there *ARE* ways to hasten things along),\nit means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many\nmore points in the Master's section.  I may occasionally offer hints\nif you seem to be having trouble.  If I do, I'll warn you in advance\nhow much it will affect your score to accept the hints.

There are a few minor bugfixes and cosmetic changes.  You\ncan now save a game and resume it at once (formerly you had to wait a\nwhile first), but it now costs you a few points each time you save the\ngame.
